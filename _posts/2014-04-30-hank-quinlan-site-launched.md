FInally I got the courage to sit for IELTS Exam, It was 10th of October, 2019. Me and my friend together registered in the IDP Dhanmondi Center, We prepared for around 1 Month. As my english basic was good enough, I was quite confident about achieving my desired Band. I only followed some of the basic IELTS contents that everyone follows. My Overall band was 7.0 with no band less than 6.0. I'm going to write a detailed 25days strategy for newcomers who want to ace the IELTS on their first attempt. 

Stay Tuned.
